Test
====
This test simply starts the proxy, then starts a server which it
binds in the server IOR table. The client is started and connects to 
the proxy requesting a mapped reference in place of the reference 
found by using the CORBALOC string identifying the server.  The test 
succeeds if the returned reference is not nil and operational.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
