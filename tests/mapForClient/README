Test
====
This test simply starts the proxy, then starts a server which 
writes an IOR to a file. The client is started and connects to 
the proxy requesting a mapped reference in place of the reference 
found in the IOR file.  The test succeeds if the supplied
reference is not nil and not identical to the original a reference.

	To run the test use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

	the script returns 0 if the test was successful.
