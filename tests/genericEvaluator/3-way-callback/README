Test
====
This tests if it is possibly for two individual clients to 
connect to a single server instance using as_client_with_corbaloc()
to obtain a mapped server reference. The server and the two clients
must execute on separate hosts. 

Both clients pass the server a callback reference which is used by
the server. The test succeeds if both clients are able to pass the
callback reference to the server and have the server invoke a method
on it.

This test is hard to automate so it is not run as part of the Lorica 
test suite.

This is how the 3-way test must be manually run:

1) Start as server by simply: ./run_test.pl

2) Start the first client (when the server tells you it is ready) 
   on another machine by: "./run_test.pl -server <SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>"

3) Start a second client on a third machine in the same way

4) Close the server by C-c or by executing one of the clients a second
   time
