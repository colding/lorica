ORB_Option 1

#  The Null evaluator is used to map references to CORBA Objects who's
#  interfaces pass no object references in or out.
#  Use Null_Eval_Type_ID to explicitly define particular IDL types associated
#  with the Null evaluator. set Null_Evaluator_Any to "yes" to have the
#  Null evaluator handle any type that is otherwise unknown to the proxy.
#  Using this "catch-all" behavior is not recommended for a production
#  deployment.
Null_Evaluator_Any no

#  The Generic evaluator is different from the null evaluator in that it
#  works in conjunction with the Interface Repository. This means it is able
#  to map any object references passed in or out of an invocation. The types
#  handled by the Generic evaluator are configured dynamically via the IFR.
Generic_Evaluator yes

#  The Generic evaluator makes use of the Interface Repository (IFR) you may
#  obtain a performnace boost by collocating the IFR with the proxy instance.
#  However you may not always wish to do so, for instance if your site already
#  uses the IFR and you merely want the proxy to attach to that one.
#  Use the option "Collocate_IFR yes" (default no) to force the collocation
#  when collocating, you may pass command-line options to your instance
Collocate_IFR yes
