#  The Generic evaluator is different from the null evaluator in that it
#  works in conjunction with the Interface Repository. This means it is able
#  to map any object references passed in or out of an invocation. The types
#  handled by the Generic evaluator are configured dynamically via the IFR.
Generic_Evaluator yes

#  The Generic evaluator makes use of the Interface Repository (IFR) you may
#  obtain a performnace boost by collocating the IFR with the proxy instance.
#  However you may not always wish to do so, for instance if your site already
#  uses the IFR and you merely want the proxy to attach to that one.
#  Use the option "Collocate_IFR no" (default yes) to avoid collocation.
#  When collocating, you may pass command-line options to your instance using
#  the IFR_CmdOption.
