#  The Null evaluator is used to map references to CORBA Objects who's
#  interfaces pass no object references in or out.
#  Use Null_Eval_Type_ID to explicitly define particular IDL types associated
#  with the Null evaluator. set Null_Evaluator_Any to "yes" to have the
#  Null evaluator handle any type that is otherwise unknown to the proxy.
#  Using this "catch-all" behavior is not recommended for a production
#  deployment.
Null_Evaluator_Any yes

#  Setting explicit types for the null evaluator overrides the catch-all
#  configuration
#Null_Eval_Type_ID IDL:someID:1.0
#Null_Eval_Type_ID IDL:someOtherID:1.0

#  The Generic evaluator is different from the null evaluator in that it
#  works in conjunction with the Interface Repository. This means it is able
#  to map any object references passed in or out of an invocation. The types
#  handled by the Generic evaluator are configured dynamically via the IFR.
Generic_Evaluator no
