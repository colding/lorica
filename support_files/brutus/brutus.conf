# Enabling this option will add the CONNECT_IGNORE_NO_PF flag to
# the global profile section of all MAPI profiles which are 
# automatically created by Brutus Server upon logon. 
# 
# The flag is needed to connect successfully to a Public Folder-less 
# Exchange Server 2007. An Exchange Server 2007 with Public Folders 
# enabled does not need, but is not harmed by, this option.
# 
# You should not set this option unless you are connecting to an
# Exchange 2007 without public folders.
#
# Enabling this option for older versions of Exchange will have 
# adverse effects.
#
# The CONNECT_IGNORE_NO_PF flag is NOT implicitly set on MAPI 
# profiles created programmatically by Brutus clients. You must
# set the flag yourself on those MAPI profiles or use the option
# in BrutusLogOn::CreateProfile().

# A list of one or more users that will by content scrambled. Content
# scrambling is done by Brutus Server when the content of specific 
# MAPI properties are converted to the corresponding Brutus values.
# This feature is only supported on Brutus Server testing builds. It
# has no effect whatsoever on any other Brutus Server builds.
#
# This option will only work reliably if PROCESS_PER_SESSION is 
# "yes". The actual effect of enabling this option if 
# PROCESS_PER_SESSION is disabled is undefined.
#
# Every value byte contained in the properties below is converted 
# into the ASCII replacement character specified:
#
#    MAPI Property      | ASCII Replacement character
#    ------------------------------------------------
#                       |
#    PR_BODY            | 'B'
#    PR_ATTACH_DATA_BIN | 'A'
#    PR_SUBJECT         | 'S'
#    PR_BODY_HTML       | 'H'
#
#
# The list of users that will be content scrambled is a whitespace 
# separated list of user names in the usual <WINDOWS DOMAIN\USERNAME> 
# format, in UPN <user@DNS_domain_name> format or in any other 
# authentication format supported by your network environment. The 
# user entries are case-insensitive. 
#
# It is important to note that if the to-be-content-scrambled user 
# authenticates using UPN format then his entry in this list must
# be in UPN format as well. 
#
# In other words: The user must authenticate using a format so that 
# a simple case-insensitive substring search can be used to pick out 
# his name within the CONTENT_SCRAMBLED_USERS list. 
#
# You must therefore specify all content scrambled users in all 
# authentication formats that your network environment supports. 
# Brutus Server does not convert between different authentication 
# formats.
#
# You can add the special user name "none" to entirely disable content 
# scrambling. "none" is case-sensitive.
# 
# Options: 
#	   list is empty ==> disabled
#	   list contains "none" ==> putting the word "none" into the list disables content scrambling
#          "domain\username [more users]" ==> whitespace separated list of users that will by content scrambled
#
# Examples:
#    A list that enables content scrambling for two users;
#       CONTENT_SCRAMBLED_USERS Domain1\User1 User2@DNS_Domain2.com
#
#    A list that disables content scrambling;
#       CONTENT_SCRAMBLED_USERS Domain1\User1 none User2@DNS_Domain2.com
#
CONTENT_SCRAMBLED_USERS none
